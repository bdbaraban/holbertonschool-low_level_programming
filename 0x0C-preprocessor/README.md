# C - Preprocessor
In this project, I learned about common predefined macros in C while practicing implementing my own and include-guarding header files.

## Tasks
* **Object-like Macro**
  * `0-object_like_macro.h`
  * Header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.

* **Pi**
  * `1-pi.h`
  * Header file that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.

* **File name**
  * `2-main.c`
  * C program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from followed by a new line.

* **Function-like macro**
  * `3-function_like_macro.h`
  * Header file that defines a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.

* **SUM**
  * `4-sum.h`
  * Header file that defines a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.
