In this project, I learned about common predefined macros in C while practicing implementing my own and include-guarding header files.

---

* `0-object_like_macro.h`: Header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.
* `1-pi.h`: Header file that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.
* `2-main.c`: C program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from followed by a new line.
* `3-function_like_macro.h`: Header file that defines a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.
* `4-sum.h`: Header file that defines a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.
