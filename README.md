# Low-Level Programming and Algorithm

This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and 
algorithm track at Holberton School. In these projects, which  occurred 
throughout the duration of the Year 1 curriculum, I learned the C programming 
language. The specific list of projects contained follows:

 * 0x00. C - Hello, World
 * 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
 * 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
 * 0x03. C - More functions, more nested loops
 * 0x04. C - Pointers, arrays and strings
 * 0x05. C - More pointers, arrays and strings
 * 0x06. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
 * 0x07. C - Recursion
 * 0x08. C - Static libraries
 * 0x09. C - argc, argv
 * 0x0A. C - malloc, free
 * 0x0B. C - More malloc, free
 * 0x0C. C - Preprocessor
 * 0x0D. C - Structures, typedef
 * 0x0E. C - Function pointers
 * 0x0F. C - Variadic functions
 * 0x10. C - printf
 * 0x11. C - Singly linked lists
 * 0x12. C - More singly linked lists
 * 0x13. C - Bit manipulation
 * 0x14. C - File I/O
 * 0x16. C - Doubly linked lists
 * 0x17. C - Dynamic libraries
 * 0x18. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
 * 0x19. C - Hash tables
 * 0x1A. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
