In this project, I continued to learn about using nested loops and writing functions in C.

* `holberton.h`: Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.
* `_putchar.c`: C function that writes a character to `stdout`.

* `0-isupper.c`: C function that checks for uppercase characters. Returns `1` if the character is uppercase, `0` otherwise.
* `1-isdigit.c`: C function that checks for a digit (`0` through `9`). Returns `1` if the character is a digit, `0` otherwise.
* `2-mul.c`: C function that multiplies two integers. Returns the value of the multiplication.
* `3-print_numbers.c`: C function that prints the numbers `0` to `9`, followed by a new line.
* `4-print_most_numbers`: C function that prints the numbers `0` to `9` except for `2` and `4`, followed by a new line.
* `5-more_numbers.c`: C function that prints the numbers `0` to `14`, followed by a new line, ten times.
* `6-print_line.c`: C function that draws a straight line in the terminal using the character `_`, followed by a new line.
  * If the function receives length input of zero or less, only a new line is printed.

* `7-print_diagonal.c`: C function that draws a diagonal line in the terminal using the `\` character, followed by a new line.
  * If the function receives length input of zero or less, only a new line is printed.

* `8-print_square.c`: C function that prints a square using the `#` character, followed by a new line.
  * If the function receives size input of zero or less, only a new line is printed.

* `9-fizz_buzz.c`: C program that prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, but for multiples of three, `Fizz` is printed instead of the number, for multiples of five, `Buzz`, and for multiples of both three and five, `FizzBuzz`.
  * Each number or word is separated by a space.

* `10-print_triangle.c`: C function that prints a triangle using the `#` character, followed by a new line.
  * If the function receives size input of zero or less, only a new line is printed.

* `100-prime_factor.c`: C program that prints the largest prime factor of the number `612852475143`, followed by a new line.
* `101-print_number.c`: C function that prints an integer without using `long`, arrays, pointers, or hard-coded special values.
