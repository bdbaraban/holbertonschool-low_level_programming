In this project, I learned about using operators, variables and loops in C.

* `0-positive_or_negative.c`: C program that prints whether a randomly generated number is positive or negative:
  * Completion of [this source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_c).
  * Stores a different random number every time the program is run.
  * Prints the number followed by:
    * If the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
    * If the number is 0: `is zero`
    * If the number is less than 0: `is negative`

* `1-last_digit.c`: C program that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number:
  * Completion of [this source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/1-last_digit_c).
  * Stores a different value every time the program is run.
  * Prints the string `Last digit of` [number] `is` [last_digit] followed by:
    * If the digit is greater than 5: `and is greater than 5`
    * If the digit is 0: `and is 0`
    * If the digit is less than 6 and not 0: `and is less than 6 and not 0`

* `2-print_alphabet.c`: C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice.
* `3-print_alphabets.c`: C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, then in uppercase, followed by a newline, using only the `putchar` function exactly three times.
* `4-print_alphabt.c`: C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase except for the letters `q` and `e`, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice.
* `5-print_numbers.c`: C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line.
* `6-print_numberz.c`: C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a newline, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice without any variables of type `char`.
* `7-print_tebahpla.c`: C program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice.
* `8-print_base16.c`: C program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly three times.
* `9-print_comb.c`: C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, using only the `putchar` function exactly four times without any variables of type `char`:
  * Numbers are separated by `,`, followed by a space.
  * Numbers are printed in ascending order.

* `10-print_comb2.c`: C program that prints the numbers from `00` to `99` using only the `putchar` function exactly five times without any variables of type `char`:
  * Numbers are separated by `,`, followed by a space.
  * Numbers are printed in ascending order, with two digits.

* `100-print_comb3.c`: C program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits using only the `putchar` function exactly five times without any variables of type `char`:
  * Numbers are separated by `,`, followed by a space.
  * The two digits are different.
  * `01` and `10` are considered the same combination of the two digits `0` and `1`.
  * Prints only the smallest combination of two digits.
  * Numbers are printed in ascending order.

* `101-print_comb4.c`: C program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits using only the `putchar` function exactly six times without any variables of type `char`:
  * Numbers are separated by `,`, followed by a space.
  * The three digits are different.
  * `012`, `120`, `102`, `021`, `201` and `210` are considered the same combination of the three digits `0`, `1` and `2`.
  * Prints only the smallest combination of three digits.
  * Numbers are printed in ascending order.

* `102-print_comb5.c`: C program that prints all possible combinations of two-digit numbers using only the `putchar` function exactly eight times without any variables of type `char`:
  * Numbers range from `0` to `99`.
  * Two numbers are separated by a space.
  * Numbers are printed with two digits [ie. `1` is printed as `01`].
  * `00 01` and `01 00` are considered the same as the combination of of the numbers `0` and `1`.
  * Combinations of numbers are separated by `,`, followed by a space.
  * Combinations of numbers are printed in ascending order.
