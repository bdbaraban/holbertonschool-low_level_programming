# C - Hello, World
In this project, I learned about compilation using `gcc`, entry points using `main`, and text-printing functions in C.

## Tasks
* **Preprocessor**
  * `0-preprocessor`: Bash script that runs a C file saved in the variable `$CFILE` through the preprocessor and saves the result in the file `c`.

* **Compiler**
  * `1-compiler`: Bash script that compiles a C file saved in the variable `$CFILE` that does not link; saves the result in an output file of the same name but with a `.o` extension.
    * Example: If the C file is `main.c`, the output is `main.o`.

* **Assembler**
  * `2-assembler`: Bash script that generates the assembly code of a C code saved in the variable `$CFILE`; saves the result in an output file of the same name but with a `.s` extension.
    * Example: If the C file is `main.c`, the result is `main.s`.

* **Name**
  * `3-name`: Bash Script that compiles a C file saved in the variable `$CFILE` and creates an executable `cisfun`.

* **Hello, puts**
  * `4-puts.c`: C program that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line, using the function `puts`.

* **Hello, printf**
  * `5-printf.c`: C program that prints exactly `with proper grammer, but the outcome is a piece of art,`, followed by a new line, using the function `printf`.

* **Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation**
  * `6-size.c`: C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

* **Intel**
  * `100-intel`: Script that generates the assembly code in Intel syntax of a C file saved in the variable $CFILE; saves the result in an output file of the same name but with a `.s` extension.
    * Example: If the C file is `main.c`, the output is `main.s`.

* **UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity**
  * `101-quote.c`: C program that prints exactly `and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19`, followed by a new line, to the standard error, without using any functions listed in the NAME sesction of the man(3) `printf` or man(3) `puts`.
