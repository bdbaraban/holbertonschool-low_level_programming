In this project, I learned about compilation, entry points, and text-printing functions in C.

* `0-preprocessor`: Script that runs a C file saved in the variable `$CFILE` through the preprocessor and saves the result in the file `c`.
* `1-compiler`: Script that compiles a C file saved in the variable `$CFILE` that does not link; saves the result in an output file of the same name but with a `.o` extension.
* `2-assembler`: Script that generates the assembly code of a C code saved in the variable `$CFILE`; saves the result in an output file of the same name but with a `.s` extension.
* `3-name`: Script that compiles a C file saved in the variable `$CFILE` and creates an executable `cisfun`.
* `4-puts.c`: C program that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line, using the function `puts`.
* `5-printf.c`: C program that prints exactly `with proper grammer, but the outcome is a piece of art,`, followed by a new line, using the function `printf`.
* `6-size.c`: C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
* `100-intel`: Script that generates the assembly code in Intel syntax of a C file saved in the variable $CFILE; saves the result in an output file of the same name but with a `.s` extension.
* `101-quote.c`: C program that prints exactly `and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19`, followed by a new line, to the standard error, without using any functions listed in the NAME sesction of the man(3) `printf` or man(3) `puts`.
