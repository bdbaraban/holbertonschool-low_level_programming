In this project, I learned about using pointers, arrays, and strings in C.

* `holberton.h`: Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.
* `_putchar.c`: C function that writes a character to `stdout`.


* `0-reset_to_98.c`: C function that takes a pointer to an `int` as a parameter and updates the value it points to to `98`.
* `1-swap.c`: C function that swaps the value of two integers.
* `2-strlen.c`: C function that returns the length of a string.
* `3-puts.c`: C function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to `stdout`.
* `4-print_rev.c`: C function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
* `5-rev_string.c`: C function that reverses a string.
* `6-puts2.c`: C function that prints every other character of a string, followed by a new line.
* `7-puts_half.c`: C function that prints the second half of a string, followed by a new line.
* `8-print_array.c`: C function that prints an input `n` elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
  * Numbers are separated by a comma followed by a space.
  * Numbers are displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array.

* `9-strcpy.c`: C function that copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (`\0`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.
  * Returns the pointer to `dest`.

* `100-atoi.c`: C function that converts a string to an integer without using `long`, new variable arrays, or hard-coded special values, as follows:
  * The number in the string can be preceded by an infinite number of characters.
  * Takes into account all `+` and `-` signs before the number.
  * If there are no numbers in the string, the function returns `0`.
